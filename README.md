# blog
A simple blog app

This is assignment work for Frontend mestari class which I am attending.

The source code and documentation is located at: https://github.com/JariLatvanen/blog

A runnable .jar is located at: https://github.com/JariLatvanen/blog/releases/myapp-0.1.0.jar

Just download the jar and run it then use http://localhost:8080/index
to run the application.
